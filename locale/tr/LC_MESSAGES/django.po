This is a freely offered service we provide as we are able, and we hope to see more community users become active over time in answering each others' questions. When we think a particular query is beyond these free support parameters we will inform the user that it may be necessary to address it as paid, commercial support. Examples include questions that are too in-depth and time-consuming to investigate and answer or questions that involve unsupported tools or platforms. Please keep in mind that we have to prioritize our client assignments so that we can pay our bills and continue to provide free software and free community support.</p>\n"

"                </ul>\n"
"                <p>We find it easiest to clearly answer posts that are <strong>complete</strong> and <strong>succinct</strong> - that is, posts that include all important details about the software environment and what led to the error, but that also trim away any details  or code snippets that aren't directly relevant to the mater at hand. Thanks for helping us to make the User Forum a vibrant and positive place!</p>\n"
