# atom-translations

XLIFF files for AtoM that have been converted so the style of the XLIFF is
the same as the style Weblate produces.

How this repo works
-------------------

Each non-master branch should correspond to an AtoM version. Switch to, or
create, the appropriate branch for the AtoM major version being worked with.

Branch name example: `2.5.x`

Migration scripts
-----------------

Scripts that can change XLIFF style to and from Weblate's style (versus AtoM's
style) live here:
